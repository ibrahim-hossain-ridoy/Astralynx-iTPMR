# Astralynx-Tri-Phase_Modular_Recycler
The Integrated Tri-Phase Modular Recycler (iTPMR) is a compact system for Martian missions that recycles plastic, metal, and foam/fabric waste into usable materials. By creating a closed-loop ecosystem, it reduces reliance on Earth resupply and supports sustainable, self-sufficient living on Mars.

# 🌌 Integrated Tri-Phase Modular Recycler (iTPMR)

The **Integrated Tri-Phase Modular Recycler (iTPMR)** is a conceptual system designed for **long-duration Martian missions**. It combines the functionality of three recycling systems—**plastic, metal, and foam/fabric**—into a single, compact, and efficient unit.  

## 🚀 Project Goal  
The iTPMR aims to create a **closed-loop recycling ecosystem** that reduces reliance on costly and infrequent **resupply missions from Earth**. By transforming waste into reusable raw materials, astronauts can support **on-site manufacturing, equipment repair, and habitat construction**, making human presence on Mars more **sustainable and self-sufficient**.

## 🔧 Features  
- **Multi-material processing**: Handles plastics, metals, and foam/fabric waste  
- **Compact & robust design**: Optimized for limited Martian habitat space  
- **Closed-loop recycling**: Converts waste into usable raw materials  
- **Supports mission longevity**: Reduces dependency on Earth resupply  

---

## 🌌 Why It Matters  
Waste management and resource utilization are **critical challenges** for extraterrestrial missions. The iTPMR addresses both by transforming discarded materials into valuable resources—helping pave the way for **long-term human settlement on Mars**.
