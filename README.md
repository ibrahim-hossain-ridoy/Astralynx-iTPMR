# Astralynx-Tri-Phase_Modular_Recycler
The Integrated Tri-Phase Modular Recycler (iTPMR) is a compact system for Martian missions that recycles plastic, metal, and foam/fabric waste into usable materials. By creating a closed-loop ecosystem, it reduces reliance on Earth resupply and supports sustainable, self-sufficient living on Mars.

The Integrated Tri-Phase Modular Recycler (iTPMR) is a conceptual system designed for long-duration Martian missions. It combines the functionality of three recycling systemsâ€”plastic, metal, and foam/fabricâ€”into a single, compact, and efficient unit.

ðŸš€ Project Goal

The iTPMR aims to create a closed-loop recycling ecosystem that reduces reliance on costly and infrequent resupply missions from Earth. By transforming waste into reusable raw materials, astronauts can support on-site manufacturing, equipment repair, and habitat construction, making human presence on Mars more sustainable and self-sufficient.

ðŸ”§ Features

1. Multi-material processing: Handles plastics, metals, and foam/fabric waste.

2. Compact & robust design: Optimized for limited Martian habitat space.

3. Closed-loop recycling: Converts waste into usable raw materials.

4. Supports mission longevity: Reduces dependency on Earth resupply.

ðŸŒŒ Why It Matters

Waste management and resource utilization are critical challenges for extraterrestrial missions. The iTPMR addresses both by transforming discarded materials into valuable resourcesâ€”helping pave the way for long-term human settlement on Mars.
