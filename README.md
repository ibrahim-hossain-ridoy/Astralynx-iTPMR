# Astralynx-Tri-Phase_Modular_Recycler
The Integrated Tri-Phase Modular Recycler (iTPMR) is a compact system for Martian missions that recycles plastic, metal, and foam/fabric waste into usable materials. By creating a closed-loop ecosystem, it reduces reliance on Earth resupply and supports sustainable, self-sufficient living on Mars.
