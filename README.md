# 🚀 Integrated Tri-Phase Modular Recycler (iTPMR)

Team Astralynx | NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2025  
Challenge: Space Trash Hack  

---

## 🌍 Project Overview  

The Integrated Tri-Phase Modular Recycler (iTPMR) is our solution for the Space Trash Hack challenge at the NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2025.  

Long-duration missions on Mars face a critical issue: waste accumulation and resupply dependence. Traditional systems use separate machines for plastics, metals, and soft materials. Our innovation consolidates these into a single, modular, and compact unit that transforms waste into valuable resources for astronauts, fostering a closed-loop ecosystem on the Martian surface.  

The iTPMR helps ensure sustainability, self-sufficiency, and reduced reliance on Earth-based resupply missions.

## 🛰️ Core Objectives  

- ✅ Provide an all-in-one recycling system for plastics, metals, and foam/fabrics.  
- ✅ Reduce astronaut workload with automated waste sorting and processing.  
- ✅ Enable in-situ manufacturing with recycled materials (3D printing filament, metal ingots, composite blocks).  
- ✅ Ensure safety with robust gas filtration and sealed design.  
- ✅ Minimize payload by integrating multiple machines into one compact unit.

## 🛠️ Design and Engineering Blueprint  

### ⚙️ Overall Design  
- Compact modular unit: 2m x 1.5m x 1.8m  
- Built with high-grade aluminum alloys & titanium  
- Energy-efficient: 5–6 kW draw from habitat grid  

### 🔄 Shared Waste Input & Sorting  
- Single intake chamber for all waste  
- Automated sensors & robotic arms for sorting  
- Reduces contamination risks and astronaut workload  

### ⚡️ Universal Shredding Unit  
- One shredder for all material types  
- Saves space and power compared to separate shredders  

### 🧩 Integrated Processing Modules  
- Plastics → Melted & extruded into 3D printing filament  
- Metals → Induction heating to produce reusable ingots/rods  
- Foam/Fabric → Compressed into durable composite blocks for insulation/structures  

### 🛡️ Centralized Safety & Control  
- Unified control panel for full-system management  
- Advanced gas filtration for toxic fumes
